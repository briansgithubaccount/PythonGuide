Python for Data Science in Professional Envronments

## Motivation
Often, when learning to code in an academic setting, more focus is put on things like syntax, data structures, algorithms, trying to learn new ways of accomplishing a task and not much on the things that tend to be more important in professional settings. Things like readability, maintainability, following coding standards, and being able to work in a team-based environment are often overlooked, because most achievement is individual. 

In a professional setting, we're very rarely inventing anything new. You'll rarely need to rewrite a sorting algorithm, or rebuild a depth first search. There are standardized libraries for that, and more often than not, they'll be good enough. More often, we're combining building blocks that other people have built in novel ways, and more effort should be put into readability and maintainability of the code. 

It's great to have a legendary 10x coder who is able to do everything better than the rest of the team, but without documentation and continuity, it is horrible for a business. The 10x coder may get hit by a bus, or choose to take another job, and the team needs a strategy to keep going. Having unreadable and unmaintable code from the legendary coder,  will often lead to the code being scrapped or rewritten in a way where a team can maintain the code.

This document tries to bridge the gap between an academic and professional environments and provide guidelines to help new professionals adapt to a team-based way of working.

## Caveats
This document is written from my point of view - and I am not a legendary coder, nor do I have familiarility with the outside a very specific scope of the area where I work. This document will focus on Python for Data Science in a Windows environment, although many principles will apply, or can be adapted to other environments.

## Guidelines

### Version Control
* Why? Why not just used shared drives
* Merging Code
* Git vs Perforce
* Gitlab

### Testing
* Why? What value does it bring?

### Virtual Environments
* Use Them (why?)
* Fragmentation of Environment
* Conda

### Communication

#### Project Management

#### Communicating with the Business
* Clear and repeat back

#### Priority Management

#### Team Management
* No heroes
* Responsibilities of a senior
